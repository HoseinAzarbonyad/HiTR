The goal is to remove generality and impurity from topic models. General topics only include common information from a background corpus and are assigned to most of the documents in the collection. Impure topics contain words that are not related to the topic. A hierarchical re-estimation approach for topic models is developed to combat generality and impurity; the method operates at three levels: words, topics, and documents:

1. Document Re-estimation (DR) re-estimates the language model per document P (w | d) and removes general words from documents before training topic models; 
2. Topic Re-estimation (TR) re-estimates the language model per topic P (w | t) and removes general words from trained topics; 
3. Topic Assignment Re-estimation (TAR) re-estimates the distribution over topics per document P (t | d) and removes general topics from documents.

# Usage

An example on how to run the code is given in HiTR.py. Depending on the combination of the mentioned re-estimation approaches that you want to use, you can disable or enable them. 

## Input
1. corpus: the corpus should be in document_id-term_id matrix format, known as .mm in Gensim. This is the same as the input format for gensim.models.LdaModel.
2. dictionary: the dictionary is the same as gensim.corpora.Dictionary (in .dict format).
3. ldapath: the path to where the lda model will be saved.
4. outPutPath: the path to where the topic-assignments will be saved.

## Output
1. The re-estimated document-term matrix and will be stored in mtsamples-tmp.mm.
2. The re-estimated topics will be saved as lda-TR.model.
3. The re-estimated topic-assignments will be returned after running TAR step.
